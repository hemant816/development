	<p><strong>When do I need to complete the end of course assessment to obtain the certificate?</strong></p>
	<p>You will need to complete the course before the end date of xxxxx to obtain the e-certificate. If you're unable to do this you would have to wait until the next time we run this course for the opportunity to do the exam.</p>
	<p><strong>Will the e-certificate state the grade I achieved on the final exam?</strong></p>
	<p>No, the e-certificate will not state the grade achieved on the final exam. A complete record of your scores on all course assignments and exams appears on the course Progress page. If you need a record of your performance in a course, use your web browser to print one of these pages.</p>
	<p><strong>I have purchased the course but am not able to complete the course before the closing date. Can I carry across my payment to the next run of the course?</strong></p>
	<p>If you have purchased the course and do not complete the course before the closing date, you cannot carry over the payment you've made for future runs of the course.</p>
	<p><strong>Is there a single verified e-certificate for all the courses or will each course have its own certificate?</strong></p>
	<p>There is a e-certificate for each course you complete.</p>
	<p><strong>Is the e-certificate free to obtain on completion of the course?</strong></p>
